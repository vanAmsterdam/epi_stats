DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

The ICU data set consists of a sample of 200 subjects who were part of
a much larger study on survival of patients following admission to an adult
intensive care unit (ICU).  The major goal of this study was to develop a
logistic regression model to predict the probability of survival to hospital
discharge of these patients and to study the risk factors associated with 
ICU mortality.  A number of publications have appeared which have focused on
various facets of the problem.  The reader wishing to learn more about the
clinical aspects of this study should start with Lemeshow, Teres, Avrunin,
and Pastides (1988).
