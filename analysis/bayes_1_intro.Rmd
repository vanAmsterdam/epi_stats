# Intro

Tutor: Herbert Hoijtink

# Overview

1. Prior distribution
2. Density of the data
3. Posterior distribution



# Prior distributions

Prior elicitation: getting formal prior knowledge from researchers

## Beta distribution

Probablilities: Beta distribution

$$Beta(\alpha = n_{successes} + 1, \beta = n_{failures} + 1)$$


Always formulate a prior distirbution, even if you don't use it in your analysis

$$h(\theta) \sim \theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}$$

Mode of Beta:

$$Mode(\theta) = \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}$$


Mean 

$$E(\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{\alpha + \beta}$$

Variance

$$var(\theta) = \frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta+1)}$$



With bayes:

Sample parameters from posterior distributions

You can do inference on combinations of the parameters, 
just sample them, create combination, and then compute mean / variance / median / 95% CI etc



## P-value

$$P = P(T(y^{rep})>T(y)|H_0)$$

Where $T$ is the test statistic.

They are only usefull when the null-hypothesis is a probable description of the 
population you are interested in.


Anything between setting up experiments and doing analysis that involves 
using your data is questionable.


For t-test and F-test (both are pivot tests):
p-value is uniformly distributed under null-hypothesis

Not pivot tests:

- chi-square test
- likelihood ratio test

Then asymptotically, p-value is uniformly distributed (not for smaller samples)


P value is probability of data under null-hypothesis, but not probability 
of the hypothesis given the data.


### P-value in Bayesian statistics

Posterior predictive p-value

Discrepency measure (test statistic that also takes into account the prior knowledge)

1. take null model, with distribution with unknown theta (model should be interesting and tell something!)
2. calculate posterior probability from data and prior distributions
3. sample theta from posterior distribution
4. sample data with sampled theta from hypothesized model
5. calculate discrepency measure
6. calculate proportions of successes and failures

In general, not normally distributed under null-hypothesis

These p-value should be close to 0.5 to reject null-hypothesis

Start with model that is interesting


Sobel: theory needs to be falsifyable (Popper) but also plausible
 


Science is not objective, objectiveness is the asymptote of science
