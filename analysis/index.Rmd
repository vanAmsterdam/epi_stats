## Modern Methods in Data Analysis

## Notes
Due to how this website was made, the R-code 'thinks' it is in the `analysis` 
subdirectory, while the data sits in the `data` directory, which is found from 
the parent directory. To circumvent changing directory all the time, this 
packege uses the function `fromParentDir`, which allows you to call files from 
the parent directory. The function can be found in the package `epistats`, 
which can be installed with `devtools::install_github("vanAmsterdam/epistats")`

If `devtools` is not yet installed, first run `install.packages("devtools")`
