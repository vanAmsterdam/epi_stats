This website is made to share the assignments I worked out for "Classical Methods in Data Analysis" from the Epidemiology Graduate Program of the Julius Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands

### Assignments
[assignments week 1](assignments_week1.html)

[assignments week 2](assignments_week2.html)

[assignments week 3](assignments_week3.html)

[case studies (not finished!)](case_studies.html)


### Notes
Due to how this website was made, the R-code 'thinks' it is in the `analysis` 
subdirectory, while the data sits in the `data` directory, which is found from 
the parent directory. To circumvent changing directory all the time, this 
packege uses the function `fromParentDir`, which allows you to call files from 
the parent directory. The function can be found in the package `epistats`, 
which can be installed with `devtools::install_github("vanAmsterdam/epistats")`

If `devtools` is not yet installed, first run `install.packages("devtools")`
