This website is made to share the assignments I worked out for 
statistic courses in the Epidemiology Graduate Program of the Julius Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands

## Modern Methods in Data Analysis

### Assignments
[assignments week 1](assignments_week1.html)
[assignments week 2](assignments_week2.html)

## Notes
Due to how this website was made, the R-code 'thinks' it is in the `analysis` 
subdirectory, while the data sits in the `data` directory, which is found from 
the parent directory. To circumvent changing directory all the time, these 
files use the function `fromParentDir`, which allows you to call files from 
the parent directory. The function can be found in the package `epistats`, 
which can be installed with `devtools::install_github("vanAmsterdam/epistats")`

If `devtools` is not yet installed, first run `install.packages("devtools")`


### Function from a package

Sometimes different packages provide functions with the same names. 
For example, `read_spss` exists in both `foreign` and `heaven`. 

To make sure you use the intended function 
(and to circumvent using `library(package)`), use `<package>::<function>` 
to use `<function>` from package `<package>`
