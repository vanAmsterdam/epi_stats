## Modeling time

Either formulate with random effects, which determines the var-covar matrix

Or: model fixed effects only, then model dependence of residuals

Possible models:

- independent or scaled identity
- exchangeable or compound symmetry (fixed correlation between all measurements)
-> gives intra-class correlation coefficient
$\frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma_0^2}$; is identical to random intercept, no random slope;
and identical to repeated measures anova

- unstructured correlation (all are free)
- autoregressive of order 1: AR(1) (correlations are $\rho ^{distance}$)
- autoregressive of order 1: AR(1), can add heterogeneous variances
- can take fractional powers to account for non-equally spaced observations

Adding autocorrelation to linear mixed effect models:

- correlation between residuals close together (high resid on T = t, also high resid on T = t + 1)
- only works when you have enough time-points per persons

Formulation:
Recall model linear mixed model:
𝑦_i𝑗=𝛽_0+𝛽_1 𝑋_1𝑖𝑗+_0𝑖+_1𝑖 𝑋_1𝑖𝑗+𝜀_𝑖𝑗
In matrix formulation:
𝒀_𝑖=𝑿_𝑖∙𝜷+𝒁_𝑖∙_𝑖+𝜺_𝑖
where 𝑿_𝑖 is the covariate matrix of the fixed effect(s) and 𝒁_𝑖 the design matrix of the random effect(s)
Variance-covariance matrix of repeated measures y:
𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝒀_𝑖 )=𝒁_𝑖∙𝜮_∙〖𝒁_𝑖〗^′+〖𝜎_𝑒〗^2∙𝑰_(𝑛_𝑖 )


Baseline measurements:

- in the setting ofSee Fox for notation

 a trial, baseline measurement is more like a covariate than an outcome

- in observational study: first measurement is just the first outcome
